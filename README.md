# Exuberant API

Hi there! If you're looking at this you've stumbled upon a beta version of Exuberant! This version of Exuberant is built for iOS 10 and is written in Objective-C.

### Why is Exuberant open source?

It isn't. The beta is open source. The reason it's open source is because I, the creator known as [TorpedoSkyline](https://twitter.com/torpedoskyline), went through the Team Treehouse Techdegree to learn iOS development. It was in here that the idea of Exuberant was created, and I decided to use it as a project in the techdegree.

### Can I use it for my Halo 5 project?

Feel free! But note that you're not getting the Exuberant that Exuberant is today. It has and will change a lot over the years, as 343 releases Halo 6 and we (maybe someday) incorporate support for Halo Wars 2. This beta version is written in Objective-C. Today's Exuberant is written in Swift. Today's Exuberant is basically a full Halo social network. This Exuberant is mostly a match history and profile viewer. 

That's pretty much it. Have fun, and happy hacking!
